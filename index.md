## Benson Liu Portfolio
I am a Junior at NC State, currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science. My area of interest is software engineering.

I have a versatile skill set, through personal projects and coursework. I have gained experience working in numerous languages, including Java, JavaScript, Python, C, CSS, and HTML. I have worked with various tools, such as GitHub, VSCode, Eclipse, Linux, Jenkins, Selenium, and Android Studio.

I am currently looking for an internship, to gain industry experience and contribute in building software.
